## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We take security, trust, and transparency seriously. [The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)](https://www.va.gov/) appreciates the work of security researchers and has developed a program to make it easier to report vulnerabilities to the VA and to recognize you for your effort to make the Internet a better place. This policy provides our guidelines for reporting vulnerabilities to the VA.

The VA security team acknowledges the valuable role that independent security researchers play in internet security. As a result, we encourage responsible reporting of any vulnerabilities that may be found in our site or applications that are within the scope of this policy. The VA is committed to working with security researchers to verify and address any potential vulnerabilities that are reported to us.

Please review these terms before you test and/or report a vulnerability. The VA pledges to not initiate legal action against researchers for penetrating or attempting to penetrate our systems as long as they adhere to this policy. 

## Purpose

This policy is intended to give security researchers clear guidelines for conducting vulnerability discovery activities directed at in-scope VA web properties, and submitting discovered vulnerabilities to the VA.

## Scope

Any public-facing website owned, operated, or controlled by the VA, including web applications hosted on those sites. However, the health and safety of our Veterans seeking medical care is of the highest priority, so this scope **EXCLUDES** any Veterans Health Administration, VA Medical Center, or other medically-related websites, applications, or devices that could interfere with Veterans seeking health-related services.

## Authorization

If you make a good faith effort to comply with the scope and spirit of this policy during your security research, we will consider your research to be authorized, will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly, and VA will not initiate or recommend legal action related to your research.

## Guidelines

We require that you:

* Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction or manipulation of data.
* Only use exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability. Do not use an exploit to compromise or exfiltrate data, establish command line access and/or persistence, or use the exploit to "pivot" to other systems. Once you've established that a vulnerability exists, or encountered any of the sensitive data outlined below, you must stop your test and notify us immediately.
* Keep confidential any information about discovered vulnerabilities for up to 90 calendar days after you have notified VA. For details, please review **[Coordinated Disclosure](#coordinated-disclosure)**.
* Do not exfiltrate PII or PHI data under any circumstances.
* Do not intentionally compromise the privacy or safety of VA personnel, or any third parties.

Common vulnerabilities we're seeking include:

* Cross-site scripting
* Cross-site request forgery
* Mixed-content scripts
* Authentication or authorization flaws
* Server-side code execution bugs

## Exclusions

* Physical attacks against VA employees, offices, and data centers.
* Social engineering of VA employees, contractors, vendors, or service providers.
* Network denial of service (DoS or DDoS) tests.
* Knowingly posting, transmitting, uploading, linking to, or sending any malware.
* Pursuing vulnerabilities which send unsolicited bulk messages (spam) or unauthorized messages.

If you encounter any of the below on our systems while testing within the scope of this policy, **[stop your test and notify us](#reporting-a-vulnerability) immediately**:

* Personally identifiable information
* Financial information (e.g. credit card or bank account numbers)
* Protected health information
* Proprietary information or trade secrets of companies of any party

## Reporting a Vulnerability

While the Vulnerability Disclosure Program is being bootstrapped, please direct reports via email to Aaron Wieczorek at [`aaron.wieczorek@va.gov`](mailto:aaron.wieczorek@va.gov).

Reports should include:

* Description of the location and potential impact of the vulnerability.
* A detailed description of the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability. Proof of concept (POC) scripts, screenshots, and screen captures are all helpful. Please use extreme care to properly label and protect any exploit code.
* Any technical information and related materials we would need to reproduce the issue.

Please keep your vulnerability reports current by sending us any new information as it becomes available.

We may share your vulnerability reports with [US-CERT](https://www.us-cert.gov/ais), as well as any affected vendors or open source projects.

## Coordinated Disclosure

VA is committed to patching vulnerabilities within 90 days or less, and disclosing the details of those vulnerabilities when patches are published. We believe that public disclosure of vulnerabilities is an essential part of the vulnerability disclosure process, and that one of the best ways to make software better is to enable everyone to learn from each other's mistakes.

At the same time, we believe that disclosure in absence of a readily available patch tends to increase risk rather than reduce it, and so we ask that you refrain from sharing your report with others while we work on our patch. If you believe there are others that should be informed of your report before the patch is available, please let us know so we can make arrangements.

We may want to coordinate an advisory with you to be published simultaneously with the patch, but you are also welcome to self-disclose if you prefer. By default, we prefer to disclose everything, but we will never publish information about you or our communications with you without your permission. In some cases, we may also have some sensitive information that should be redacted, and so please check with us before self-disclosing.

## Legal

You must comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws in connection with your security research activities or other participation in this vulnerability disclosure program.

VA does not authorize, permit, or otherwise allow (expressly or impliedly) any person, including any individual, group of individuals, consortium, partnership, or any other business or legal entity to engage in any security research or vulnerability or threat disclosure activity that is inconsistent with this policy or the law. If you engage in any activities that are inconsistent with this policy or the law, you may be subject to criminal and/or civil liabilities.

To the extent that any security research or vulnerability disclosure activity involves the networks, systems, information, applications, products, or services of a non-VA entity (e.g., other Federal departments or agencies; State, local, or tribal governments; private sector companies or persons; employees or personnel of any such entities; or any other such third party), that non-VA third party may independently determine whether to pursue legal action or remedies related to such activities.

If you conduct your security research and vulnerability disclosure activities in accordance with the restrictions and guidelines set forth in this policy, (1) VA will not initiate or recommend any law enforcement or civil lawsuits related to such activities, and (2) in the event of any law enforcement or civil action brought by anyone other than VA, VA will take steps to make known that your activities were conducted pursuant to and in compliance with this policy.

VA may modify the terms of this policy or terminate the policy at any time.
